#Little Quiz for multiple Use (v1.1)


## Set up questions

The questions must be stored into the `questions.js` file.


## Set up images

Put the images under `images/`. Their names should be:

```
BUTTON_ID_richtig.gif
BUTTON_ID_geklick.gif
BUTTON_ID_ungeklick.gif
```

Where `ID` is `0` to `3`. For the background image
place `background.gif` into `images/`


## Set up style

The style must be adjusted manually to the length of the messages
and the size of the images. So this task is up to you.
